The only goal of readODS is to enable R to read and write OpenDocument Spreadsheet (ODS) files.

## Installation

Install the latest stable version from CRAN: 

```r
install.packages("readODS")
```

Or install the development version from Github:

```r
devtools::install_github("chainsawriot/readODS")
```

## Usage

In almost all use cases, you only need two functions: `read_ods` and `write_ods`. Simple.

#### Reading

```{r}
library(readODS)
read_ods("starwars.ods")
```

Reading from the 2nd sheet

```{r}
read_ods("starwars.ods", sheet = 2)
```

Reading from a specific range

```{r}
read_ods("starwars.ods", sheet = 2, range = "A1:C11")
```

#### Writing

```{r}
## preserve the row names
write_ods(mtcars, "mtcars.ods", row_names = TRUE)
```

Appending a sheet

```{r}
write_ods(PlantGrowth, "mtcars.ods", append = TRUE, sheet = "plant")
```

```{r}
## Default: First sheet
read_ods("mtcars.ods")
```

```{r}
read_ods("mtcars.ods", sheet = "plant", range = "A1:B10")
```

### About the speed and file size

This package is written entirely in R. Although the efficiency has been improved, please don't expect the heavily optimized performance of [readxl](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/), [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) and data.table's [fread](https://cran.r-project.org/package=data.table).

Also, this package can't handle ODS files larger than "medium size". See [issue #71](https://github.com/chainsawriot/readODS/issues/71).

If you need to read and write large ODS files efficiently, the [headless interface of LibreOffice](https://help.libreoffice.org/Common/Starting_the_Software_With_Parameters) is recommended. See [issue #49](https://github.com/chainsawriot/readODS/issues/49) for an example.

This package emulates the behaviors of `readxl::read_xlsx`, `writexl::write_xlsx` and `xlsx::write.xlsx`.

This package should be a silent member of `rio`, so that you don't need to care about file format anymore.
